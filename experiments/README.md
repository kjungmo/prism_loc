# Synthetic experiments for the PRISM-Loc paper

These three standalone drivers produce every number and every data point shown
in the paper's synthetic-evaluation section (`docs/paper/sections/validation.tex`)
and its figures (`docs/paper/figures/fig_mcl.tex`, `fig_kld.tex`, `fig_bbs.tex`,
`fig_eskf.tex`). They compile the **actual estimator cores**
(`prism_loc_core/src/*.cpp`, `prism_loc_fusion/src/*.cpp`) directly with `g++`
and Eigen — no ROS, no CMake, no colcon workspace.

All data are **synthetic**: worlds, laser scans, odometry, and inertial streams
are generated inside the drivers. All randomness derives from **fixed
compile-time seeds** (never wall-clock), so the CSVs are bit-for-bit
reproducible — with the single exception of the wall-clock query-latency column
in the BBS experiment, which is machine-dependent.

Prerequisites: a C++17 compiler and Eigen 3 headers (Debian/Ubuntu:
`sudo apt install g++ libeigen3-dev`; headers land in `/usr/include/eigen3`).
Run all commands from the repository root.

## 1. `mcl_tracking.cpp` — MCL pose tracking + KLD adaptation

Drives the real `prism_loc_core::ParticleFilter` + `Laser2DLikelihoodField`
with KLD-adaptive resampling, in the exact predict → correct → resample order
used by `localization_node.cpp`, around a 65 s closed oval loop at 10 Hz in a
12 m × 10 m occupancy grid. Parameters mirror `prism_loc/params/laser2d.yaml`.
Three fixed seeds: 101, 202, 303.

```sh
g++ -O2 -std=c++17 \
  -I prism_loc_core/include -I prism_loc_core/test -I /usr/include/eigen3 \
  prism_loc_core/src/*.cpp experiments/mcl_tracking.cpp -o /tmp/exp_mcl
/tmp/exp_mcl
```

Output CSVs (written to `docs/paper/data/` relative to the working directory —
run the drivers from the repo root):

- `docs/paper/data/mcl_tracking.csv` — time, position error, yaw error per seed
- `docs/paper/data/mcl_particles.csv` — KLD particle count per seed

Feeds `fig_mcl.tex` and `fig_kld.tex`.

## 2. `bbs_relocalization.cpp` — kidnapped-robot global relocalization

Runs the real `prism_loc_core::BranchAndBoundMatcher` (with the
`laser2d.yaml` `bbs_*` defaults) over N = 100 kidnapped-robot queries in the
asymmetric 6 m × 6 m room from the BBS unit test. Scans are corrupted with a
per-query clutter fraction drawn uniformly in [0, 0.8]. Fixed seed: 20240607.
Success criterion: position error < 0.5 m AND yaw error < 10°.

```sh
g++ -O2 -std=c++17 \
  -I prism_loc_core/include -I prism_loc_core/test -I /usr/include/eigen3 \
  prism_loc_core/src/*.cpp experiments/bbs_relocalization.cpp -o /tmp/exp_bbs
/tmp/exp_bbs
```

Output CSV (same absolute-path caveat as above — the `std::fopen` path near the
bottom of the driver):

- `docs/paper/data/bbs_relocalization.csv` — true/recovered pose, score,
  score fraction, position/yaw error, wall-clock query time, success flag

The `time_ms` column is wall-clock and machine-dependent; every other column is
deterministic. Feeds `fig_bbs.tex`.

## 3. `eskf_fusion.cpp` — ESKF fusion under a 10 s aiding dropout

Drives the real `prism_loc_fusion::Eskf` over a synthetic 60 s 3-D
figure-eight with IMU at 200 Hz, NDT-like 6-DoF pose updates at 10 Hz, and
GNSS-like position updates at 1 Hz (`fusion3d.yaml` noise defaults; fixed true
IMU biases the filter must estimate). Both aiding streams are withheld for
t ∈ [25, 35) s. Fixed seed: 20240517. Logs at 2 Hz to stdout.

```sh
g++ -O2 -std=c++17 \
  -I prism_loc_fusion/include -I /usr/include/eigen3 \
  prism_loc_fusion/src/*.cpp experiments/eskf_fusion.cpp -o /tmp/exp_eskf
/tmp/exp_eskf > docs/paper/data/eskf_track.csv
```

Output CSV:

- `docs/paper/data/eskf_track.csv` — time, position-error norm, the filter's
  own 3-sigma position bound, per-sensor activity flags

Feeds `fig_eskf.tex`.

## Regenerating the paper

After (re-)running the drivers:

```sh
cd docs/paper && tectonic main.tex
```

The figure `.tex` files read the CSVs via pgfplots `table` directives with
paths relative to `docs/paper/`, so no further wiring is needed.
